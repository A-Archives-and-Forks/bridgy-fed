===

Bridgy Fed connects different decentralized social network protocols. It currently supports the [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) (eg [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)) via [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/) via the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), and the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) via [webmentions](https://webmention.net/) and [microformats2](https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2). [Farcaster](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/447) and [Nostr](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/446) are under consideration. Bridgy Fed translates profiles, likes, reposts, mentions, follows, and more from any supported network to any other. [See the user docs](https://fed.brid.gy/docs) and [developer docs](https://bridgy-fed.readthedocs.io/) for more details.

Development
---
Development reference docs are at [bridgy-fed.readthedocs.io](https://bridgy-fed.readthedocs.io/). Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to [ping me in #indieweb-dev](https://indieweb.org/discuss) with any questions.

First, fork and clone this repo. Then, install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and run `gcloud components install cloud-firestore-emulator` to install the [Firestore emulator](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/emulator). Once you have them, set up your environment by running these commands in the repo root directory:


```sh
gcloud config set project bridgy-federated
python3 -m venv local
source local/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# needed to serve static files locally
ln -sf local/lib/python3*/site-packages/oauth_dropins/static oauth_dropins_static
```

Now, run the tests to check that everything is set up ok:

```shell
gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port=:8089 --database-mode=datastore-mode < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
python3 -m unittest discover
```

Finally, run this in the repo root directory to start the web app locally:

```shell
env FLASK_ENV=development APPVIEW_HOST=api.bsky.app PLC_HOST=plc.directory BGS_HOST=bsky.network PDS_HOST=atproto.brid.gy flask --debug run -p 8080
```

If you send a pull request, please include (or update) a test for the new functionality!

If you hit an error during setup, check out the [oauth-dropins Troubleshooting/FAQ section](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins#troubleshootingfaq).

You may need to change [granary](https://github.com/snarfed/granary), [oauth-dropins](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins), [mf2util](https://github.com/kylewm/mf2util), or other dependencies as well as as Bridgy Fed. To do that, clone their repo locally, then install them in "source" mode with e.g.:

```sh
pip uninstall -y granary
pip install -e <path to granary>
```

To deploy to the production instance on App Engine - if @snarfed has added you as an owner - run:

```sh
gcloud -q beta app deploy --no-cache --project bridgy-federated *.yaml
```


How to add a new protocol
---

1. Determine [how you'll map the new protocol to other existing Bridgy Fed protocols](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#translate), specifically identity, protocol inference, events, and operations. [Add those to the existing tables in the docs](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/templates/docs.html) in a PR. This is an important step before you start writing code.
1. Add the new protocol to `DEBUG_PROTOCOLS` in [`models.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/models.py).
1. Implement the id and handle conversions in [`ids.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/ids.py).
1. If the new protocol uses a new data format - which is likely - add that format to [granary](https://github.com/snarfed/granary) in a new file with functions that convert to/from [ActivityStreams 1](https://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/) and tests. See [`nostr.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/main/granary/nostr.py) and [`test_nostr.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/main/granary/tests/test_nostr.py) for examples.
1. Implement the protocol in a new `.py` file as a subclass of both [`Protocol`](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/protocol.py) and [`User`](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/models.py). Implement `send`, `fetch`, `serve`, `target_for`, `create_for`, and other necessary methods from `Protocol`, and `handle`, `handle_for_id`, `web_url`, and other necessary methods from `User` .
1. TODO: add a new usage section to the docs for the new protocol.
1. TODO: does the new protocol need any new UI or signup functionality? Unusual, but not impossible. Add that if necessary.
1. Protocol logos may be emoji or image files. If this one is a file, add it `static/`. Then add the emoji or file `<img>` tag in the `Protocol` subclass's `LOGO_HTML` constant.


How to post as the protocol bot accounts: @ap.brid.gy, @bsky.brid.gy, etc
---
The protocol bot accounts - [@ap.brid.gy](https://bsky.app/profile/ap.brid.gy), [@bsky.brid.gy](https://mastodon.social/@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy), and so on - don't have user-facing UIs to log into and post as, but it's still possible to post as them! Here's how.

They're currently set up as [bridged _web_ accounts](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#web-get-started). To post to them, first create a blog post _without title_ on [snarfed.org](https://snarfed.org/), _check that it's under 300 chars for Bluesky_, then send a [webmention](https://webmention.net/) to Bridgy Fed to make it bridge the post. The source should be of the form eg `https://[subdomain].brid.gy/internal/[URL]`, where URL is the snarfed.org post's URL, _without_ `https://`, eg `https://ap.brid.gy/internal/snarfed.org/2025-06-09_55084`.

```
curl -v -H "Authorization: `cat flask_secret_key`" \
  -d source=https://ap.brid.gy/internal/snarfed.org/... \
  -d force=true \
  https://fed.brid.gy/webmention

curl -v -H "Authorization: `cat flask_secret_key`" \
  -d source=https://bsky.brid.gy/internal/snarfed.org/... \
  -d force=true \
  https://fed.brid.gy/webmention
```

(Ideally we'd like to be able to do this from [blog.anew.social](https://blog.anew.social/) too! [They don't support microformats in the default theme](https://indieweb.org/Ghost#Rejected_microformats2_markup_in_default_theme), though, so we'd need to switch to a microformats-enabled theme first. ðŸ˜•)


Stats
---

I occasionally generate stats and graphs of usage and growth via BigQuery, [like I do with Bridgy](https://bridgy.readthedocs.io/#stats). Here's how.

1. [Export the full datastore to Google Cloud Storage.](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/export-import-entities) Include all entities except `MagicKey`. Check to see if any new kinds have been added since the last time this command was run.

    ```
    gcloud datastore export --async gs://bridgy-federated.appspot.com/stats/ --kinds Follower,Object
    ```

    Note that `--kinds` is required. [From the export docs](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/export-import-entities#limitations):
    > _Data exported without specifying an entity filter cannot be loaded into BigQuery._
1. Wait for it to be done with `gcloud datastore operations list | grep done`.
1. [Import it into BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-datastore#loading_cloud_datastore_export_service_data):

    ```
    for kind in Follower Object; do
      bq load --replace --nosync --source_format=DATASTORE_BACKUP datastore.$kind gs://bridgy-federated.appspot.com/stats/all_namespaces/kind_$kind/all_namespaces_kind_$kind.export_metadata
    done
    ```
1. Check the jobs with `bq ls -j`, then wait for them with `bq wait`.
1. [Run the full stats BigQuery query.](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=664405099227:58879d2908824a21b737eee98fff2de8) Download the results as CSV.
1. [Open the stats spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OtOZ2Rb4EqAGEp9rHziWkyJD4BaRFb_971KjOqMKePA/edit) Import the CSV, replacing the _data_ sheet.
1. Check out the graphs! Save full size images with OS or browser screenshots, thumbnails with the _Download Chart_ button.
