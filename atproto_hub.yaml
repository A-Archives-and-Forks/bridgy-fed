  # steady state is 3-4G memory for 50k rollback window, but it can spike higher at
  # startup, before the rollback window is full when multiple subscribers are reading
  # their own versions of history.

  # ...but GAE Flex's limit is 6G per core. :(
  #
  # also note that GAE Flex supposedly only bills for the memory we actually use,
  # not the amount we reserve here
