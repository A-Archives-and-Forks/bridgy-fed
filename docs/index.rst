Bridgy Fed developer documentation
----------------------------------

Bridgy Fed connects different decentralized social network protocols. It
currently supports the
`fediverse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse>`__ (eg
`Mastodon <https://joinmastodon.org>`__) via
`ActivityPub <https://activitypub.rocks/>`__,
`Bluesky <https://bsky.social/>`__ via the `AT
Protocol <https://atproto.com/>`__, and the
`IndieWeb <https://indieweb.org/>`__ via
`webmentions <https://webmention.net/>`__ and
`microformats2 <https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2>`__.
`Farcaster <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/447>`__ and
`Nostr <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/446>`__ are under
consideration. Bridgy Fed translates profiles, likes, reposts, mentions,
follows, and more from any supported network to any other. `See the user
docs <https://fed.brid.gy/docs>`__ and `developer
docs <https://bridgy-fed.readthedocs.io/>`__ for more details.

Development
-----------

Development reference docs are at
`bridgy-fed.readthedocs.io <https://bridgy-fed.readthedocs.io/>`__. Pull
requests are welcome! Feel free to `ping me in
#indieweb-dev <https://indieweb.org/discuss>`__ with any questions.

First, fork and clone this repo. Then, install the `Google Cloud
SDK <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/>`__ and run
``gcloud components install cloud-firestore-emulator`` to install the
`Firestore
emulator <https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/emulator>`__. Once you
have them, set up your environment by running these commands in the repo
root directory:

.. code:: sh

   gcloud config set project bridgy-federated
   python3 -m venv local
   source local/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # needed to serve static files locally
   ln -sf local/lib/python3*/site-packages/oauth_dropins/static oauth_dropins_static

Now, run the tests to check that everything is set up ok:

.. code:: shell

   gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port=:8089 --database-mode=datastore-mode < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
   python3 -m unittest discover

Finally, run this in the repo root directory to start the web app
locally:

.. code:: shell

   env FLASK_ENV=development APPVIEW_HOST=api.bsky.app PLC_HOST=plc.directory BGS_HOST=bsky.network PDS_HOST=atproto.brid.gy flask --debug run -p 8080

If you send a pull request, please include (or update) a test for the
new functionality!

If you hit an error during setup, check out the `oauth-dropins
Troubleshooting/FAQ
section <https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins#troubleshootingfaq>`__.

You may need to change `granary <https://github.com/snarfed/granary>`__,
`oauth-dropins <https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins>`__,
`mf2util <https://github.com/kylewm/mf2util>`__, or other dependencies
as well as as Bridgy Fed. To do that, clone their repo locally, then
install them in ‚Äúsource‚Äù mode with e.g.:

.. code:: sh

   pip uninstall -y granary
   pip install -e <path to granary>

To deploy to the production instance on App Engine - if @snarfed has
added you as an owner - run:

.. code:: sh

   gcloud -q beta app deploy --no-cache --project bridgy-federated *.yaml

How to add a new protocol
-------------------------

1. Determine `how you‚Äôll map the new protocol to other existing Bridgy
   Fed protocols <https://fed.brid.gy/docs#translate>`__, specifically
   identity, protocol inference, events, and operations. `Add those to
   the existing tables in the
   docs <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/templates/docs.html>`__
   in a PR. This is an important step before you start writing code.
2. Add the new protocol to ``DEBUG_PROTOCOLS`` in
   `models.py <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/models.py>`__.
3. Implement the id and handle conversions in
   `ids.py <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/ids.py>`__.
4. If the new protocol uses a new data format - which is likely - add
   that format to `granary <https://github.com/snarfed/granary>`__ in a
   new file with functions that convert to/from `ActivityStreams
   1 <https://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/>`__ and tests. See
   `nostr.py <https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/main/granary/nostr.py>`__
   and
   `test_nostr.py <https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/main/granary/tests/test_nostr.py>`__
   for examples.
5. Implement the protocol in a new ``.py`` file as a subclass of both
   `Protocol <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/protocol.py>`__
   and
   `User <https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/blob/main/models.py>`__.
   Implement ``send``, ``fetch``, ``serve``, ``target_for``,
   ``create_for``, and other necessary methods from ``Protocol``, and
   ``handle``, ``handle_for_id``, ``web_url``, and other necessary
   methods from ``User`` .
6. TODO: add a new usage section to the docs for the new protocol.
7. TODO: does the new protocol need any new UI or signup functionality?
   Unusual, but not impossible. Add that if necessary.
8. Protocol logos may be emoji and/or image files. If this one has a
   file, add it ``static/``. Then add the emoji and/or file ``<img>``
   tag to the ``Protocol`` subclass‚Äôs ``LOGO_EMOJI`` and/or
   ``LOGO_HTML`` constants.

How to post as the protocol bot accounts: @ap.brid.gy, @bsky.brid.gy, etc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The protocol bot accounts -
`@ap.brid.gy <https://bsky.app/profile/ap.brid.gy>`__,
`@bsky.brid.gy <https://mastodon.social/@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy>`__,
and so on - don‚Äôt have user-facing UIs to log into and post as, but it‚Äôs
still possible to post as them! Here‚Äôs how.

They‚Äôre currently set up as `bridged web
accounts <https://fed.brid.gy/docs#web-get-started>`__. To post to them,
first create a blog post *without title* on
`snarfed.org <https://snarfed.org/>`__, *check that it‚Äôs under 300 chars
for Bluesky*, then send a `webmention <https://webmention.net/>`__ to
Bridgy Fed to make it bridge the post. The source should be of the form
eg ``https://[subdomain].brid.gy/internal/[URL]``, where URL is the
snarfed.org post‚Äôs URL, *without* ``https://``, eg
``https://ap.brid.gy/internal/snarfed.org/2025-06-09_55084``.

::

   curl -v -H "Authorization: `cat flask_secret_key`" \
     -d source=https://ap.brid.gy/internal/snarfed.org/... \
     -d force=true \
     https://fed.brid.gy/webmention

   curl -v -H "Authorization: `cat flask_secret_key`" \
     -d source=https://bsky.brid.gy/internal/snarfed.org/... \
     -d force=true \
     https://fed.brid.gy/webmention

(Ideally we‚Äôd like to be able to do this from
`blog.anew.social <https://blog.anew.social/>`__ too! `They don‚Äôt
support microformats in the default
theme <https://indieweb.org/Ghost#Rejected_microformats2_markup_in_default_theme>`__,
though, so we‚Äôd need to switch to a microformats-enabled theme first.

Stats
-----

I occasionally generate stats and graphs of usage and growth via
BigQuery, `like I do with
Bridgy <https://bridgy.readthedocs.io/#stats>`__. Here‚Äôs how.

1. `Export the full datastore to Google Cloud
   Storage. <https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/export-import-entities>`__
   Include all entities except ``MagicKey``. Check to see if any new
   kinds have been added since the last time this command was run.

   ::

      gcloud datastore export --async gs://bridgy-federated.appspot.com/stats/ --kinds Follower,Object

   Note that ``--kinds`` is required. `From the export
   docs <https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/export-import-entities#limitations>`__:
   > *Data exported without specifying an entity filter cannot be loaded
   into BigQuery.*

2. Wait for it to be done with
   ``gcloud datastore operations list | grep done``.

3. `Import it into
   BigQuery <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-datastore#loading_cloud_datastore_export_service_data>`__:

   ::

      for kind in Follower Object; do
        bq load --replace --nosync --source_format=DATASTORE_BACKUP datastore.$kind gs://bridgy-federated.appspot.com/stats/all_namespaces/kind_$kind/all_namespaces_kind_$kind.export_metadata
      done

4. Check the jobs with ``bq ls -j``, then wait for them with
   ``bq wait``.

5. `Run the full stats BigQuery
   query. <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=664405099227:58879d2908824a21b737eee98fff2de8>`__
   Download the results as CSV.

6. `Open the stats
   spreadsheet. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OtOZ2Rb4EqAGEp9rHziWkyJD4BaRFb_971KjOqMKePA/edit>`__
   Import the CSV, replacing the *data* sheet.

7. Check out the graphs! Save full size images with OS or browser
   screenshots, thumbnails with the *Download Chart* button.
